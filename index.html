 <p><strong>Plot: </strong>Holden has been expelled from another school, but, before going back to his parents he decides to spendsome time in New York...</p>	 	

 <p><strong>My opinion: </strong>I admit I started the book only because of the incipit. I read it somewhere, it cited David Copperfield and it was sarcastic. It had me! (Plus, it was on my "to be read" list).<br>
The book was banned and censored several times from its publication, and I understand the reasons: one word out of five is a curse, there are blasphemies, very homophobic conversations and Holden, the main character, isn't exactly a role model (he smokes a lot, he gets drunk and most of his arguments aren't socially adequate).<br>
But I really liked it, a lot. I loved the cynicism of the book and the way it tells everything exactly how a sixteen-years-old boy would do (curses included). I know Holden isn't a role model, but through the book I got his own perception of the events and with everything that happens to him... how can I blame him? I'm always empathetic toward the main characters.<br>
Holden Caufiled is also sensitive, innocent (he always believes in the children), kind and he tries to solve his problems the best he can do. I liked him from the very beginning and every time he was feeling depressed (always) I was broken-hearted. His slang made me laugh, his digressions made me know him better and when I wasn't reading, I started missing Holden.<br>
The writing style is unique: the slang, the repeated words and the digressions. What I liked from the book is how it follows the exact thoughts of a sixteen-years-old boy. Wonderful. Moreover, is there a teenager which isn't obsessed with a few words? Because Holden couldn't stop saying "phony", "corny" and a bunch of curses. Everything was so realistic. And Holden, like every hyperactive teenage, often thought about a word or saw a thing and started to remember something from the past. I laughed a lot.<br>
I read some reviewers don't think the book is a coming-of-age fiction,but I disagree: the Holden from the last chapter has seen and experienced way more things than the Holden from the first chapter, receiving also a lot of advice from his mentor. And, why not, at the end he aknowledges his wrongs and tries to become better. Isn't it enough for a coming-of-age fiction?

<p><strong>Spoiler alert: </strong>according to a theoryÂ¿ I read, at the end, when Holden wants to go away in the West, Holden and Phoebe switch their roles: the sister becomes the "catcher", while the main character the "fallen". In fact, Holden wanted to "work" on a cliff through the rye and catch the children who could literally fall down, but at the end Holden himself is figuratively falling. At that point, Phoebe on the carousel makes Holden happier causing him to stay. Plus, Holden gives Phoebe his hunting hat, which makes him a catcher. I just wanted to share this theory, it's amazing!<br>
I would have liked knowing more about D.B.. I need more Holden-D.B. moments to understand better their relationship.
